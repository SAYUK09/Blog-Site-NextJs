title: "Working With Tanay Pratap"
date: "2021-06-08"
---

I along with 15 more folks are lately working with **Tanay Pratap** on 3 Projects.
Its more like an internship.

I consider myself fortunate, to be working with **Tanay Pratap** at an early stage of my life.
These learnings will definitely help me ace in my career.

The thought of building a Real-World Project, which will actually be used by people, excites me a lot.
With excitement comes fear too. The self-doubt of not be able to complete the given task.
But I know, even if I fail at few tasks, I'll be in a better position.
And more or less failing now, will help me conquer in the near future.

## Here's how its going !

<!-- 8 June to 10 June (2 day deadline) -->

`8 June 2021 : `
Just got started with **NextJs**. Learnt the basics of NextJs while building this simple blog site.
The [Vercel Tutorial Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) were extremely well structured.

The next task is to learn how **Product Research** is done.
I believe this a great skill to have, and gives an edge on the competition.

`11 June 2021 : `
Few folks showcased their **Product Research Document** and it was truly mesemerizing to see all the presentation.
I really learnt a lot and got a rough idea how PRD are done.
Loved it!

`13 June 2021 :`
Few more folks including me presentated their **Product Research Document**.
It was again an amazing session. I learnt how to think when planning to build a product.

> Also understood there's a lot of planning and efforts involved behind the scences in making of any product.

`16 June 2021 : `
Folks presentated their **Product Research Document** on Wzyr like web app.
Wyzr is a subscription-based service where people can read books and authors can publish their books. The broad objective of the app is to reduce the barrier to entry for both writers as well as readers.
_Thinking on this project idea was a bit challenging for me, as I am not that much of reader._

`21 June 2021 : `
2 Teams formed to work on 2 web apps respectively.
Github access provided to team members.
Unfortunately my college exams didn't allow me to contribute in any of these 2 projects.

`24 June 2021 : `
Meetings were held for walking us through the PRD and explaining the work flow.
Amazing work by Tanvi on explaining us how work is done in professionally in industry.
After seeing Tanvi presenting the PRD

> My Respect for Product Manager just increased by 10X

Understood the role of PM closely, learnt different jargon and industry terms.
Overall a great value packed session with a disclaimer to work hard.
PS : I am not in any of the team due my exams, but I still decided to join the meeting and I don't regret that.
We felt like we could call ourself like **Product Engineer at Neog** post working.

`26 June 2021 : `
The agenda of today's meeting was to **Assign Tasks** to team members.
Thanks Tanay for sheding light on Engineering Design Doc, and telling us it's importance in well established companies.
The task for next 24 hours is to come up with Engineering Doc.
This would be a fascinating task, I guess.
The best part today was that, **I happened to be assigned a team**
I am excited as well as scared right now.

> Finally working as a team with Tanay Pratap & Tanvi and building a Product which will have a userbase of 3000+ users!

`27 June 2021 : `
Today few folks presented their **Engineering Docs** , we had impromptu vital discussion over few points that were presented. And then we realised the significance of Engineering Docs.
Omkar was extra-odinary today and raised the bar for other folks!
We will be have another meeting tomorrow and will be continuing with the presentations.

`28 June 2021 : `
Continued with **Engineering Docs Presentation**.
Also Tanay told us how a project is setup, creating templates for issues, PRs, configuring ESlint, prettier etc. Good amount of knowledge there.
Had another meeting in the evening, where Tanay showed us how to up **Azure with NextJs and Typescript**.
Lot of information there.
_I am constantly amazed with the work of all teamates. I have so much to learn_. Getting my BE game strong with the help of _Omkar_ is on top of my list.
Also spent few moments with _Sushil_ where he gave me some Golden UI Tips, (then I quickly pulled up PR and requested him to shower more knowledge). **I am sure, I'll get a lot better at UI at the end of this internship**

`29 June 2021 : `
Nothing much today, everyone was working on POC and small tasks assigned to them & we had a scrum call in the evening.

`30 June 2021 : `
Well, this a special day

> Tanay's Birthday! & tanay doesn't works on his special day.

So, we had no meetings today. Tanay asked us to take a break, but I believe almost everyone was working individually.

`1 July 2021 : `
We had a **Daily Standup Call** in the afternoon and we decided to host the daily stand up calls early morning, that is around 8AM or 9AM (well, this is _early_ for most of the folks, including me.)
We had another meeting with few folks to discuss about few changes in the `dashboard` design.
That was a good discussion, talked over a few important stuff.

> Sushil asked if would like to work on `404` page, & I didn't it second thought at all.

So, I worked on the `404 page`. Played with `Chakra UI`.
Faced difficulties in setting up `yarn` on my local machine.
Was frustated for few moments there.
Also I would like to thank Mehul for helping me.

After doing all of this, I was ready to publish my branch until I discovered **I didn't have github access** to do so.

`2 July 2021 : `
As usual stand up call was conducted. Everyone was working at a good pace. And Tanvi interpreted that the app would be out in time.
**Team Admin** that is Me, Sushil and Soham decided to make _Admin Screens_ by tomorrow 2pm.
We divided the tasks and started working on the **UI**.
I was assigned the **review-portfolio** page, as Sushil worked on **Login/Signup** page & Soham took up the **Reviewer Dashboard** page.

`3 July 2021 : `
Continued working on assigned task.
The first half of the day went in sending screenshots and asking for suggestions and fixing those.
By evening I had the PR out and was waiting for some reviews. _(I am so eager, actually restless to get my PRs Merged, after all its my 1st Time.)_
After a while **Prerana** Reviewed my code, & I worked on the PR changes.

`4 July 2021 : `
Merged all my **PRs** .
Learnt more about **Git, GitHub, etc**. Got a gist of how to make **OS Contributions**.
Thanks to _Soham_ for helping me out.
Also Today, I resolved my **1st Merge Conflict** _(Sounds a bit kiddish, but yeah I was happy that I was doing all of this)_
Today's standup call went on a bit long, as we were also showcasing our work.
We are planning to launch our MVP on this `Thursday` for a dry run.
So going to have a hectic week, but so excited to for the outcome.

`5 July 2021 : `
In today's stand up call, we had a demo flow of the entire app, more like as we were doing a bug bash. discussed few issues, and were told to complete the changes asap. Also everyone was given a feature/page to **bug bash**. We planned of completing all the changes and doing bug bash around 7-8pm in the evening, but

> Is it even a plan if it goes as planned!

We overestimated things, so tanvi as usual being kindest postponed the bug bash reporting to tomorrow.

`7 July : `
We shifted had standup a bit late, that is at 3:30pm because everyone was a bit busy in polishing their features and taking care of few modifications which were discussed yesterday.
We once more delayed our **Demo** to tomorrow, we'll most probably have a meeting in the second half of the day,to see our App Flow in 1 go.
Hence The Launch is delayed by a day.

`8 July : `
Didn't do much today, _was completing assignments ðŸ˜‘_
But we had meeting in the evening, we had discussion on what timelines to set for ourselves, estimations around the app launch as we realised we overestimated things.
I was assigned another feature to bug bash, so will do that. My learning from today :

> Do not hesitate to ask help, you learn faster this way!

Thanks Tanvi for this.

`9 July : `
Today was an exhuasting day, was writing assignments all day long.
Again learnt something new about `Git` and `GitHub`. After resolving some github related bugs, I started **Bug Bashing** the **Login/Signup** Pages.

> Bug Bashing is good skill to have, which require good observation power and demands you to think for different perspective

`10 July : `
Today's day was a bit occpuied with **Reactify Talks**. We had a watch party as 2 of our Neog Students too were giving a talk.
But we managed to get on quick call, where we discussed about our current status.Basically I've done **2 individual bug bashes** and now waiting for the `develop` branch to be updated with all the latest changes so that I and 2 more folks are able to do a complete `end-to-end` bug bash before the final bug bash.

`13 July : `
2 Meetings today, one in afternoon for discussing the the **Review System** Workflow and initiating **Review System** Work.
And we had a meeting at around 7:30pm for an **End-to-End Bug Bash** which went on for almost 2.5 hours.

> It was an absolute pleasure to see all the peices come togthere and work flawlessly as one Product.

_Ahh! what a moment._ Tomorrow we are having a **e2e bug bash & code review**
Let's see how it goes!

`14 July : `
So today early morning that is at **9AM** we had a call scheduled with Tanay for code reviews, where Tanay noticed that our **build** wasn't ready. Tanay after a few code reviews advised to get done with the **Build** part, Omkar and Udit were assigned that part as they were the ones who initially worked with the **Build and Backend Parts**. But Tanay asked me and _Prerana_ also to look into it, which I wanted to eargly do. After getting on a all with Omkar and Udit I once again realized that,

> I still have a lot to learn!

I really need to practice **Backend and Stuff** and get better at it.
That's all for today. We didn't have stand up call today.

`15 July : `
Today there wasn't much work as such.
So joined meeting and observed Omkar and team debug the **Build**.

`16 July : `
So today Tanay got on a meeting and looked into the **build** issue.
We all attended it and learned few tips and tricks.
And the Tanay asked to take the weekend off and relax.

`19 July :`
We are still strugling with the **Build Part** and dedicated our day for solving the same issue.

`20 July :`
Today is the day!
Tanvi asked to read the **issues regarding to the Reviewer System** and meet at 3:30pm.
We had some brainstorming session and Tanvi asked me to take up the `reviewer dashboard` work, and this is what I always wanted(Having assigned a particular github issue)!
But I was hesitating a bit to take up the work, as I had to travel to Wai, Panchgani for a engagement cermony this weekend.
I wanted to take up the work, but was afraid of not being able to complete on time.
It was a tough decision for me, but I dediced to take up the work as the mild deadline was next 2 days.
And anyways I was supposed to travel after 2 days itself.

> So Finally, today I was assigned my first work professionally.

I had work on the **UI Screens of Review Portfolio Window and 404 page** before this, but this was the 1st time I was assigned a github issue.

`27 July : `
We had a meeting where we had discussion over the **Interview System** and how would the Interviews function overall.
So as planned we had a meeting with Tanay today.
Where the **Reviewer Team** (Sushil, Prerana and I) presentated their engineering doc for the **Review System**.
Started working on the changes after this meeting.
