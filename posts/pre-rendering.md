I along with 15 more folks are lately working with **Tanay Pratap** on 3 Projects.
Its more like an internship.

I consider myself fortunate, to be working with **Tanay Pratap** at an early stage of my life.
These learnings will definitely help me ace in my career.

The thought of building a Real-World Project, which will actually be used by people, excites me a lot.
With excitement comes fear too. The self-doubt of not be able to complete the given task.
But I know, even if I fail at few tasks, I'll be in a better position.
And more or less failing now, will help me conquer in the near future.

## Here's how its going !

<!-- 8 June to 10 June (2 day deadline) -->

`8 June 2021 : `
Just got started with **NextJs**. Learnt the basics of NextJs while building this simple blog site.
The [Vercel Tutorial Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) were extremely well structured.

The next task is to learn how **Product Research** is done.
I believe this a great skill to have, and gives an edge on the competition.

`11 June 2021 : `
Few folks showcased their **Product Research Document** and it was truly mesemerizing to see all the presentation.
I really learnt a lot and got a rough idea how PRD are done.
Loved it!
