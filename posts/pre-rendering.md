title: "Working With Tanay Pratap"

I along with 15 more folks are lately working with **Tanay Pratap** on 3 Projects.
Its more like an internship.

I consider myself fortunate, to be working with **Tanay Pratap** at an early stage of my life.
These learnings will definitely help me ace in my career.

The thought of building a Real-World Project, which will actually be used by people, excites me a lot.
With excitement comes fear too. The self-doubt of not be able to complete the given task.
But I know, even if I fail at few tasks, I'll be in a better position.
And more or less failing now, will help me conquer in the near future.

## Here's how its going !

<!-- 8 June to 10 June (2 day deadline) -->

`8 June 2021 : `
Just got started with **NextJs**. Learnt the basics of NextJs while building this simple blog site.
The [Vercel Tutorial Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) were extremely well structured.

The next task is to learn how **Product Research** is done.
I believe this a great skill to have, and gives an edge on the competition.

`11 June 2021 : `
Few folks showcased their **Product Research Document** and it was truly mesemerizing to see all the presentation.
I really learnt a lot and got a rough idea how PRD are done.
Loved it!

`13 June 2021 :`
Few more folks including me presentated their **Product Research Document**.
It was again an amazing session. I learnt how to think when planning to build a product.

> Also understood there's a lot of planning and efforts involved behind the scences in making of any product.

`16 June 2021 : `
Folks presentated their **Product Research Document** on Wzyr like web app.
Wyzr is a subscription-based service where people can read books and authors can publish their books. The broad objective of the app is to reduce the barrier to entry for both writers as well as readers.
_Thinking on this project idea was a bit challenging for me, as I am not that much of reader._

`21 June 2021 : `
2 Teams formed to work on 2 web apps respectively.
Github access provided to team members.
Unfortunately my college exams didn't allow me to contribute in any of these 2 projects.

`24 June 2021 : `
Meetings were held for walking us through the PRD and explaining the work flow.
Amazing work by Tanvi on explaining us how work is done in professionally in industry.
After seeing Tanvi presenting the PRD

> My Respect for Product Manager just increased by 10X

Understood the role of PM closely, learnt different jargon and industry terms.
Overall a great value packed session with a disclaimer to work hard.
PS : I am not in any of the team due my exams, but I still decided to join the meeting and I don't regret that.
We felt like we could call ourself like **Product Engineer at Neog** post working.

`26 June 2021 : `
The agenda of today's meeting was to **Assign Tasks** to team members.
Thanks Tanay for sheding light on Engineering Design Doc, and telling us it's importance in well established companies.
The task for next 24 hours is to come up with Engineering Doc.
This would be a fascinating task, I guess.
The best part today was that, **I happened to be assigned a team**
I am excited as well as scared right now.

> Finally working as a team with Tanay Pratap & Tanvi and building a Product which will have a userbase of 3000+ users!

`27 June 2021 : `
Today few folks presented their **Engineering Docs** , we had impromptu vital discussion over few points that were presented. And then we realised the significance of Engineering Docs.
Omkar was extra-odinary today and raised the bar for other folks!
We will be have another meeting tomorrow and will be continuing with the presentations.

`28 June 2021 : `
Continued with **Engineering Docs Presentation**.
Also Tanay told us how a project is setup, creating templates for issues, PRs, configuring ESlint, prettier etc. Good amount of knowledge there.
Had another meeting in the evening, where Tanay showed us how to up **Azure with NextJs and Typescript**.
Lot of information there.
_I am constantly amazed with the work of all teamates. I have so much to learn_. Getting my BE game strong with the help of _Omkar_ is on top of my list.
Also spent few moments with _Sushil_ where he gave me some Golden UI Tips, (then I quickly pulled up PR and requested him to shower more knowledge). **I am sure, I'll get a lot better at UI at the end of this internship**
