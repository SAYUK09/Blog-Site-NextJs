I along with 15 more folks are lately working with **Tanay Pratap** on 3 Projects.
Its more like an internship.

I consider myself fortunate, to be working with **Tanay Pratap** at an early stage of my life.
These learnings will definitely help me ace in my career.

The thought of building a Real-World Project, which will actually be used by people, excites me a lot.
With excitement comes fear too. The self-doubt of not be able to complete the given task.
But I know, even if I fail at few tasks, I'll be in a better position.
And more or less failing now, will help me conquer in the near future.

## Here's how its going !

<!-- 8 June to 10 June (2 day deadline) -->

`8 June 2021 : `
Just got started with **NextJs**. Learnt the basics of NextJs while building this simple blog site.
The [Vercel Tutorial Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) were extremely well structured.

The next task is to learn how **Product Research** is done.
I believe this a great skill to have, and gives an edge on the competition.

`11 June 2021 : `
Few folks showcased their **Product Research Document** and it was truly mesemerizing to see all the presentation.
I really learnt a lot and got a rough idea how PRD are done.
Loved it!

`13 June 2021 :`
Few more folks including me presentated their **Product Research Document**.
It was again an amazing session. I learnt how to think when planning to build a product.

> Also understood there's a lot of planning and efforts involved behind the scences in making of any product.

`16 June 2021 : `
Folks presentated their **Product Research Document** on Wzyr like web app.
Wyzr is a subscription-based service where people can read books and authors can publish their books. The broad objective of the app is to reduce the barrier to entry for both writers as well as readers.
Thinking on this project idea was a bit challenging for me, as I am not that much of reader.
